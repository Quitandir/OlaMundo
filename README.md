## Technology 

This project was the product of a course about React Router. Using some of its features, like `<BrowserRouter>`, `<Routes>` and `<Outlet>`, a SPA was developed in order to use some of the resources avaliable with React Router. The idea was creating a responsive page, in which different routes could render different components.
